# WeForUs-C++-Project
This project was developed during the Introduction to Programming course using C++ language

It's a health related site from where a user can easily be able to access doctors, request for donation etc. And as well as the user can also check BMI regularly and get some health tips on it. There is a option where users can register as volunteers and work as donors.

Admin accessibility has been made to observe the work done by volunteers and user.

An ‘Emergency’ option is created where anyone can access in urgent case and see nearby hospital information or can easily find the ambulance services’ number.
